Post-Powershell Jenkins Plugin
==============================


# Purpose

The purpose of this plugin for jenkins is to provide a global post build powershell step which can be used for a number of purposes.  The main idea is to make external calls to provide build status information to external services.  The long term goal is to be able to configure this as a global level.
